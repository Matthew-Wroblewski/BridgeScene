Assignment 10 Rubric
Precondition Methods (24 pts) 
(12) Public precondition method for each method: approach(), say(), passed(), and failed() 
(12) Console Scene View prints Property Change Events from precondition methods 

Command Objects (21 pts) 
(5) Tagged “say command” and “move command” and implement Runnable 
(3) Move command only takes Avatar and two integers as arguments in its constructor 
(3) Say command only takes String as argument in its constructor 
(5) Two separate parsing methods for “say” and “move” that return Runnable-typed objects. Tagged “say parser” and “move parser” 
(5) Caller of “say parser” and “move parser” executes command using the Runnable object 

Asynchronous Animations (55 pts) 
(5) Animating methods in interpreter tagged “asynchronous Arthur”, “asynchronous Galahad”, etc. 
(10) Each method starts and runs the animation in its own thread. Animations must be demoed to run simultaneously to receive credit for this! 
(20) Animation uses one or more animating command classes that implement Runnable. Class(es) tagged “animating command” 
(20) Each animation uses some animator class with an animating method. Class(es) tagged “animator” 

Demo 
Demo all of the features specified in the Assignment 10 pdf to get credit for them! 

Extra Credit (20 pts) 
(5) Clapping guard asynchronous animation, tagged “asynchronous guard”    
      - Next assignment will build on clapping guard for more extra credit! 
(10) Dynamically enabled buttons on interpreter for approach, say, passed, and failed
(5) Awesome demo
